## Tasks Overview

1. **Creation of EC2 Instance and Connection Over SSH -->** The task involves provisioning a virtual server (EC2 instance) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and establishing a secure connection to it using SSH (Secure Shell) for remote management and operations.<br><br>
2. **Create a VPC and Launch an EC2 Instance Within It -->** This task guides us through creating a VPC and launching an EC2 instance, helping us establish a secure and isolated network environment while ensuring efficient cloud resource management.<br><br>
3. **Set Up EFS and Verify Data Sharing Between TWO EC2 Instances -->** This guide provides a comprehensive step-by-step process to set up an Elastic File System (EFS) in AWS and verify data sharing between two EC2 instances. The task demonstrates the capability of creating a scalable, shared storage solution that allows seamless data sharing across multiple EC2 instances.<br><br>
4. **AWS IAM Setup and Management -->** This guide walks you through setting up and managing AWS security with Identity and Access Management (IAM). Learn to create IAM users and groups, assign policies, manage roles, and follow best practices for secure access control in AWS.<br><br>
5. **RDS Deployment and Backup with EC2 on AWS -->** Guide to deploying a MySQL database on AWS RDS, connecting it to an EC2 instance, and creating backups.<br><br>
6. **Secure Website Deployment with Route 53 and ALB on AWS -->** This task guides you through deploying a secure website on AWS, using Route 53 for DNS management, SSL/TLS for encryption, and an Application Load Balancer for efficient traffic distribution. It covers end-to-end setup from EC2 instance creation to domain binding and certificate management.<br><br>
7. **Deploy Website to S3 with CloudFront -->** This guide provides instructions for deploying a website using Amazon S3 as the storage solution and CloudFront as the CDN.<br><br>
8. **Deploy Website to EC2 with NGINX and CloudFront -->** This guide provides instructions for deploying a website on an EC2 instance using NGINX as the web server and Amazon CloudFront as the CDN.<br><br>
9. **Angular-Java App Deployment on EC2 Instance -->** This task guides you to deploy an Angular-Java app on an EC2 instance: launch an instance, install Java, Node.js, and a web server, then deploy and run the backend and frontend, configuring necessary settings.<br><br>
10. **Secure 3-Tier AWS Deployment: Angular Frontend, Java Backend, RDS -->** This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for deploying a secure 3-tier application on AWS, featuring an Angular frontend, a Java-based backend, and a MariaDB database hosted on AWS RDS. The deployment ensures secure communication, scalable architecture, and efficient traffic management using AWS services.
