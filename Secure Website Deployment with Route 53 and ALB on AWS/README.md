**Secure Website Deployment with Route 53 and ALB on AWS**
---

This guide demonstrates how to set up a secure and scalable website using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The process includes creating an EC2 instance, configuring a web server, purchasing a domain from a third-party provider, and securing the website with SSL/TLS certificates issued by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Traffic management is handled efficiently using an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

**Task Overview**

This task guides you through setting up a secure website on AWS. You will deploy an EC2 instance, configure a web server, purchase and link a domain, and secure your site with SSL/TLS using ACM, with traffic managed by an Application Load Balancer.
Key Components

    EC2 Instance: A virtual server in AWS used to run the web server.
    Apache HTTP Server (httpd): Web server software for hosting the website.
    Route 53: AWSâ€™s scalable DNS web service for routing traffic to your application.
    SSL/TLS Certificate: Issued by ACM to secure your website.
    Application Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets.
    Third-Party Domain: A domain purchased from a provider like Hostinger and configured in AWS.

**Steps to Configure the Website**
Step 1: Set Up EC2 Instance

    Create an EC2 Instance:

    bash

ssh -i private_rsa_key ec2-user@public_ip

Install Apache HTTP Server (httpd):

bash

    sudo -i
    yum install httpd -y

Step 2: Deploy Website

    Install and Host a Free CSS Template:

    bash

    sudo wget url_of_webpage_codes

    Copy the files to the home directory of httpd at /var/www/html/.

Step 3: Configure Security

    Whitelist Ports 80 and 443 in the EC2 instance's security group.

Step 4: Set Up Domain and DNS

    Purchase a Domain from a third-party provider (e.g., Hostinger).
    Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53 to bind the domain with the public IP.
    Update Name Server (NS) Records with the domain provider.
    Create an A Record in Route 53 to bind the public IP with the domain.

Step 5: Secure the Website

    Request an SSL Certificate from ACM.
    Create a CNAME Record in Route 53 to verify domain ownership.
    Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and attach the SSL certificate.
    Update the A Record to point the domain to the ALB's DNS.

Step 6: Final Check

    Test the Domain to ensure it is accessible and secure.

**Conclusion:**

By following these steps, you will have successfully set up and secured a website using AWS services, ensuring efficient traffic management and secure communications.<br>
