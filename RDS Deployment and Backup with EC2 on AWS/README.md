**Introduction**

This guide provides detailed steps to set up and manage a MySQL database on AWS using RDS, integrate it with an EC2 instance, deploy a web application, and perform various backup operations.
Task Overview

A) RDS Service

    Setting up a MySQL database on AWS RDS.
    Deploying a web application on an EC2 instance with Apache Tomcat.

B) Database Backup on EC2 Instance

    Backing up the database in three different ways:
        Full Backup (Data and Schema)
        Schema-Only Backup
        Data-Only Backup
---
**Steps**
Step 1: Creating an EC2 Instance

Launch an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console. This instance will host the web application.
Step 2: Configuring Security Groups

Add inbound rules for the following ports:

    3306: MySQL
    8080: Apache Tomcat

Step 3: Setting Up the RDS Database

Create an RDS instance using MySQL as the database engine.
Step 4: Installing Necessary Software

On the EC2 instance:

    Install Apache Tomcat 8.5
    Install JDK 18
    Install MySQL client

Step 5: Exporting and Deploying the Application

    Export your database query and web application (.war file) to the EC2 instance.
    Copy the .war file to the webapps directory of Apache Tomcat.

Step 6: Configuring Apache Tomcat

Edit the context.xml file in the conf directory of Apache Tomcat to include RDS database details.
Step 7: Running the Application

Start Apache Tomcat using the catalina.sh script and ensure the application is running.
Step 8: Database Backup Methods

    Full Database Backup:
    mysql -h <rds_endpoint> -u <username> -p <dbname> > /path/backup.sql

    Schema-Only Backup:
    mysqldump -h <rds_endpoint> -u <username> -p --no-data <dbname> > /path/onlyschema.sql

    Data-Only Backup:
    mysqldump -h <rds_endpoint> -u <username> -p --no-create-info <dbname> > /path/onlydata.sql
---

**Output:**
After completing the setup, your web application should be accessible via the public IP of your EC2 instance. You can log in using the admin and customer credentials to verify the connection to the RDS database.

---
**Conclusion:**

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to deploying a web application using AWS services and ensuring your database is backed up effectively.
